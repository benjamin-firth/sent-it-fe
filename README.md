# This Project is currently in progress (Climbing App, similar to 8a.nu)

My own goals for the project are as follows.

- Create a full stack application for climbers to track their climbing tick list.
- Users can add a climb that theyâ€™ve done that includes a picture, description, and other info to your liking
- Users create a personal profile page which includes a preview of their most recent sends
- Utilize React, Node, & MongoDB
- Use All hooks - useState, useEffect, useContext, and at least one custom Hook
- Mobile-first design
- API must include: get, post, put, and delete endpoints
- Must choose a design inspo from the following: https://dribbble.com/search/climbing

The design inspiration I chose was this configuration image:
